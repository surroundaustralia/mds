# Model-Driven Specification

A tool that creates specification documents from models.

This is a Python program that generates PDF/HTML documents - specifications - from ontologies - models. It requires a data model - the core of the specifciation - and also a model of the non-data model elements of the specification to generate, such as introductory material, references etc.

NOTE: This tool is starting development in April, 2023, and it is a second version of an MDS tool developed in 2022. The original tool is not publicly available. Expect to see real content here late April 2023+.
